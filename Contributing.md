Pull Request Process
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators
and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

Creating a Pull Request
There are 2 main work flows when dealing with pull requests:
1 Pull Request from a forked repository
2 Pull Request from a branch within a repository

1st Process 
> Navigate to the original repository you created your fork from.
> To the right of the Branch menu, click New pull request.
> On the Compare page, click compare across forks.
> Confirm that the base fork is the repository you'd like to merge changes into.
  Use the base branch drop-down menu to select the branch of the upstream repository you'd like to merge changes into.
> Use the head fork drop-down menu to select your fork, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to select
  the branch you made your changes in.
> Type a title and description for your pull request.
> If you do not want to allow anyone with push access to the upstream repository to make changes to your PR,
  unselect Allow edits from maintainers.
> To create a pull request that is ready for review, click Create Pull Request. To create a draft pull request,
use the drop-down and select Create Draft Pull Request, then click Draft Pull Request.

You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, 
or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

Issues can be used to keep track of bugs, enhancements, or other requests.
> On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

> Click New issue.
> If there are multiple issue types, click Get started next to the type of issue you'd like to open.
> Type a title and description for your issue.
> If you're a project maintainer, you can assign the issue to someone, add it to a project board, associate it with a milestone,
